# App Store Analytics

## Overview

This project focuses on analyzing and visualizing data from the Google Play Store to provide valuable insights for app developers and marketers. By leveraging Python, Pandas, and Plotly, we aim to replicate key app store analytics features, enabling users to make informed decisions regarding app development, pricing strategies, and market opportunities.

## Key Features

1. **Duplicate Removal:**
   - Utilize Pandas to efficiently identify and remove duplicate entries from the dataset.

2. **Data Cleaning and Conversion:**
   - Remove unwanted symbols and convert data into a numeric format for better analysis.

3. **Nested Data Wrangling with Pandas:**
   - Address columns containing nested data, ensuring a clean and structured dataset.

4. **Plotly Visualizations:**
   - Create compelling visualizations using the Plotly library to represent key metrics.

## Project Files

## **Dataset**
   - We have included a new dataset file, data.csv, which contains the raw data for the Google Play Store analysis.

## **Jupyter Notebooks**
   
1. **Practice Notebook**
   - Start your exploration with the Google Play Store App Analytics (start).ipynb notebook, which includes a set of practice questions for users to engage with and understand the analysis process.

2. **Completed Notebook**
   - For users who prefer to skip the analysis and explore the completed results directly, we have included Google_Play_Store_App_Analytics_(complete).ipyn. This notebook showcases the solutions to the practice questions and serves as a reference for users 
     interested in the final outcomes.
